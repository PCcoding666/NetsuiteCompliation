# Building a Full-Stack Application Using React, Node.js, Azure Form Recognizer, and NetSuite Authentication

## Introduction

This blog post details my experience developing a full-stack application that integrates several technologies to extract structured data from invoices and integrates with NetSuite for further processing. The project includes a React frontend, a Node.js/Express backend, Azure Form Recognizer for data extraction, and Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

The blog is divided into two main sections:

1. **Setting Up the Tech Stack**
2. **Challenges Encountered and Solutions**

Let's dive into the details.

## Section 1: Setting Up the Tech Stack

### Step 1: Environment Setup on Azure Linux VM

1. **Create an Azure Linux Virtual Machine (VM)**:
    - Use the Azure portal to create an Ubuntu 20.04 or similar Linux VM.
    - Make sure to open the necessary ports (22 for SSH, 5000 for backend, 3000 for frontend).
    - SSH into your VM:
      ```bash
      ssh azureuser@your_vm_ip_address
      ```

2. **Update the System**:
    - Run the following commands to update the package lists and upgrade installed packages:
      ```bash
      sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
      ```

3. **Install Node.js and NPM**:
    - Install Node.js from the official NodeSource repository:
      ```bash
      curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
      sudo apt install -y nodejs
      ```
    - Verify the installation:
      ```bash
      node -v
      npm -v
      ```

4. **Install Redis**:
    - Install Redis to use as a vector database or cache.
      ```bash
      sudo apt install redis-server -y
      sudo systemctl enable redis-server
      sudo systemctl start redis-server
      ```

### Step 2: Frontend Setup with React

1. **Initialize a React Project**:
    - From the project root directory, create the React app:
      ```bash
      npx create-react-app frontend
      cd frontend
      ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install `axios` for making HTTP requests and the Google OAuth library:
      ```bash
      npm install axios react-google-login
      ```

3. **Set Up Google OAuth**:
    - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Create a new project and enable the Google OAuth API.
    - Create credentials for an OAuth Client ID (Web Application), specifying the authorized redirect URI as `http://localhost:3000`.
    - Store the `client_id` in a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
      ```env
      REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
      ```

4. **Implement Google OAuth Login in `FileUpload.js`**:
    - Use the `react-google-login` package to implement OAuth in the frontend:
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import { GoogleLogin } from 'react-google-login';

    const handleLoginSuccess = (response) => {
      console.log("Login Success:", response);
    };

    const handleLoginFailure = (response) => {
      console.log("Login Failed:", response);
    };

    const FileUpload = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <GoogleLogin
            clientId={process.env.REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}
            buttonText="Login with Google"
            onSuccess={handleLoginSuccess}
            onFailure={handleLoginFailure}
            cookiePolicy={'single_host_origin'}
          />
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default FileUpload;
    ```

5. **Run the React App**:
    - Start the development server:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```

### Step 3: Backend Setup with Node.js and Express

1. **Initialize the Backend**:
    - From the project root, create the backend folder:
      ```bash
      mkdir backend
      cd backend
      npm init -y
      ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install `express`, `multer` for file uploads, `cors` for cross-origin resource sharing, and `dotenv` to manage environment variables:
      ```bash
      npm install express multer cors dotenv @azure/ai-form-recognizer
      ```

3. **Set Up Azure Form Recognizer**:
    - Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    - Create an Azure Form Recognizer resource and get the `endpoint` and `key`.
    - Add these to a `.env` file in the backend:
      ```env
      AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT=https://your-endpoint.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
      AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_KEY=your_key
      ```

4. **Create the Express Server (`server.js`)**:
    - Implement the server to handle file uploads and call the Azure Form Recognizer API:
    ```javascript
    require('dotenv').config();
    const express = require('express');
    const multer = require('multer');
    const fs = require('fs');
    const cors = require('cors');
    const { FormRecognizerClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require('@azure/ai-form-recognizer');

    const app = express();
    const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });
    app.use(cors());

    app.post('/api/extract', upload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
      try {
        const filePath = req.file.path;
        const client = new FormRecognizerClient(process.env.AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT, new AzureKeyCredential(process.env.AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_KEY));

        const fileData = fs.readFileSync(filePath);
        const poller = await client.beginRecognizeInvoices(fileData, { contentType: req.file.mimetype });
        const invoices = await poller.pollUntilDone();

        // Extract relevant fields
        const extractedData = invoices.map(invoice => ({
          VendorName: invoice.fields.VendorName?.value,
          InvoiceTotal: invoice.fields.InvoiceTotal?.value,
          // Add other fields here...
        }));

        fs.unlinkSync(filePath);  // Remove the uploaded file
        res.json({ data: extractedData });
      } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error processing the file' });
      }
    });

    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
    app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
    ```

5. **Run the Backend**:
    - Start the backend server:
      ```bash
      node server.js
      ```

### Step 4: Connecting Frontend and Backend

1. **Handle File Upload in React**:
    - Implement file upload functionality in the `FileUpload.js` component:
    ```jsx
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    import axios from 'axios';

    const FileUpload = () => {
      const [file, setFile] = useState(null);
      const [data, setData] = useState(null);

      const handleFileChange = (e) => {
        setFile(e.target.files[0]);
      };

      const handleUpload = () => {
        const formData = new FormData();
        formData.append('file', file);

        axios.post('http://localhost:5000/api/extract', formData)
          .then(response => setData(response.data))
          .catch(error => console.error("Error uploading file:", error));
      };

      return (
        <div>
          <input type="file" onChange={handleFileChange} />
          <button onClick={handleUpload}>Upload and Extract</button>

          {data && (
            <div>
              <h3>Extracted Data:</h3>
              <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
            </div>
          )}
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default FileUpload;
    ```

2. **Test the Full Application**:
    - Open `http://localhost:3000` in the browser, log in using Google OAuth, and upload an image to see the extracted invoice data.

## Section 2: Challenges Encountered and Solutions

### 1. **CORS Issues Between Frontend and Backend**

**Problem**: When running the frontend on `localhost:3000` and the backend on `localhost:5000`, the browser blocked the requests due to CORS.

**Solution**: I used the `cors` package in the backend to allow cross-origin requests. Here's how it was configured:

```javascript
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
```

This resolved the CORS issue by allowing the frontend to make requests to the backend.

---

### 2. **Axios Network Errors**

**Problem**: While uploading files from the frontend, I encountered a network error from Axios, preventing the files from reaching the backend.

**Solution**: The issue was related to the backend server URL. In the frontend code, I had to ensure the backend was being accessed correctly with the full URL:

```javascript
axios.post('http://localhost:5000/api/extract', formData);
```

This resolved the issue and allowed successful file uploads.

---

### 3. **Form Recognizer API Errors**

**Problem**: While processing invoices through Azure Form Recognizer, I faced issues when dealing with unsupported file types or large file sizes.

**Solution**: I added validation to ensure only supported file types (images or PDFs) are processed and file sizes are reasonable. Additionally, I ensured that the files were deleted after processing to prevent storage issues:

```javascript
fs.unlinkSync(filePath);
```

---

### 4. **Google OAuth Misconfigurations**

**Problem**: During the setup of Google OAuth, I initially faced issues with incorrect `client_id` configuration, leading to failed login attempts.

**Solution**: I ensured that the correct redirect URI (`http://localhost:3000`) was configured in the Google Cloud Console and also double-checked that the `client_id` was correctly loaded from the environment variables:

```javascript
clientId={process.env.REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID};
```

---

### **Conclusion**

Building this full-stack application was a highly educational experience. The project taught me how to integrate various services such as Google OAuth, Azure Form Recognizer, and connect the frontend and backend effectively. I hope this guide helps you navigate through similar challenges in your projects!
